Introduction: This document says my thougth about Mathematic of Discrete Fourier Transform.
			It also documents some questions needed to be researched more deeply.

Q1 Analytic Signal
------------------
	5.3.4, P97
	
Q2 Three dimensional plot and projections
-----------------------------------------
	5.3.7, Figure 5.9, P103
	
 Q3 analytic continuation
 ------------------------
    5.3.9, recover z transform from DTFT
