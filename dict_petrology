Mafic and Felsic
	Mafic is an acronym of Ma (Magnesium) and Fic (ferric, Latin name of iron).
	Mafic rocks are rich in Magnesium and iron, dark in color, high density.
	Mafic rocks contains 50% of Silica by weight.
	
	Felsic is an acronym of feldspar (a mineral rich in  silica and aluminum) and silica. 
	Felsic rocks are lighter in color, lower density.
	Felsic rocks contains a high percentage of (granite,around 70%)silica.
	
	• Mafic and Felsic are categories into which igneous rocks are classified.

	• Silica is the most abundant material found in igneous rocks. This is why silica content has been chosen to classify igneous rocks with higher silica content making a rock Felsic while lower silica content making them Mafic. Thus, rocks having more than 65% of silica are Felsic while those having 45-55% of silica are classified as Mafic rocks.

	• Mafic rocks are rich in iron and magnesium, whereas Felsic rocks are rich in silica and aluminum.

	• Mafic rocks are denser and heavier than Felsic rocks.

	• Mafic rocks are darker in color than Felsic rocks.

	• Lava made up of Felsic rocks is slow moving and has a higher viscosity than Mafic lava.
