display manager::
    In the X Window System, an X display manager is a graphical login manager which starts
a session on an X server from the same or another computer. A display manager presents the
user with a login screen. A session starts when a user successfully enters a valid combination
of username and password. When the display manager runs on the user's computer, it starts the 
X server before presenting the user the login screen. When the display manager runs on a remote
computer, it acts like a telnet server, requesting username and password and starting a remote
session. It reallizes in the X Window System the functionality of getty and login on the 
character-mode terminals.

X:
    Type "man X" in console to refer to detail of X.
    A windowing system, which is intended to provide a diviced-independent standardized input
and output graphical environment accessiable to multiple programs, customizable and controllable
by the user.
    X uses a client-server model to achive its device and network independence.
    The server controls the services of the X system, both the actual graphics display hardware,
keyboard, and mouse, and the software services such as colors and fonts. All input and output
is actually routed through this program. This server program must run on the computer to which
display is directly attatched.
    The programs that want to access the display are called clients. These programs call the X
libarary functions to do input and output and so are independent of the actual device hardware.
They can run on any computer on the network, not just on the same computer as the display. One
of the X library functions allows them to open a connenction to a remote server. One of the 
options to the client program controls which server it will be.
    A window manager function is needed, which allows you to move or resize windows on the 
screen, make one window overlap another, turn a window into an icon to temporarily hide it, etc.
This funciton can be provided by the X server software that is controlling the hardware. But in
most cases, it is simply another client program which can run either on the computer with the 
display or on any other machine on the network.
    In the X, a display is a set of hardware consisting of one or more output screens, a 
keyboard, and a point device(mouse, assumbed to have at least 3 buttons.) The display is 
controlled by a single X server process. A computer may have more than one display numbered from
0 (zero).
    In the X, a screen is a graphics output screen. There can be more than one screen per display,
numbered from 0(zero).
    The standard Unix worksation has a single attatched display screen. X client programs runing
that workstation referenc this attched display server with the address: localhost:0.0, or 
local:0.0, or Unix:0.0, or just 0.0. An X client program can refrence a display server on a 
a remote computer by using the remote computer's host name or IP address, like
        spinel:0.0
        banach.stanford.edu:0.0
        171.64.169.204:0.0
    To use a PC as an X window display, you must run X server program on that computer. A 
delicated X terminal is basically a speciallized computer that runs only a single program--
the X server which ususally requires no active management. In its simplest form, such an 
X server program will start up on the PC without opening any windows(clients, which normally)
run on another computer and you must first establish a connection to it).
    You can use this type of X server or terminal in two different ways.
    In rooted mode, XDMCP allows X terminals to emulate a terminal directly attached to remote
computer when the X terminal is configured to use XDCMP to make connections to that remote 
computer. If the connection is created, X display manager(a special client program)  will present
you a login screen for the remote PC as you are seated in front of it. The password you typed 
will be transferred over the netwok in plain text, making it potentially valneralbe to capture.
After starting your X session via XDMCP, your normal X initialization files in your home 
directory on the remote computer will be read and executed(such as .xession or others). Thus
the standard windowing clients, including widow nanager, that takes over either the entire X 
server display or a large portion. In this rooted mode, you get full use of the X window manager
features on matter whatever the X terminal you are using.
    In the rootless mode, you use  some kind of remote command facility on the X terminal(
usually a PC, can run remote commands, instead of a just simple X terminal in this case) to 
start only specific X client programs on the remote computer which open individual windows 
on the X terminal display. In this case, the remote computer is not controlling the X 
terminal display, instead, the native system running on the X terminal controlls the client 
program window in the same way as controlling native windows.  For rootless operation,  
you can use ssh, telnet, rsh, rexec to start up remote client X programs.
    In the X Window System, an X display manager is a graphical login manager which starts
a session on an X server from the same or another computer. A display manager presents the
user with a login screen. A session starts when a user successfully enters a valid combination
of username and password. When the display manager runs on the user's computer, it starts the 
X server before presenting the user the login screen. When the display manager runs on a remote
computer, it acts like a telnet server, requesting username and password and starting a remote
session. It reallizes in the X Window System the functionality of getty and login on the 
character-mode terminals. For example,
                ----------------------------------------------------------
                    display manager        description
                ----------------------------------------------------------
                    gdm                    Gnome
                    kdm                    KDE
                    lxdm                   lxde
                    xdm                    Xorg's default DM
                    lightdm                desktop-independent
                    slim                   desktop-independent for X11
                    sddm                   X11
                    wdm                    WINGs DM
                    nodm                   for single user enviroment

X display manager control protocal:
    XDMCP uses UDP port 177. 

X-howtos::
    Run X client in rootless mode under Linux, first enable X11 forwarding
        ssh -Y ainray@172.22.11.251
    then just run client program as you are seated in front of remote computer.

Multiple monitors::
multiple monitors::
    Refer X protocol screen as SCREEN. 
    SCREEN has a one-to-one correspondence with a physical display device(a monitor).
    SCREEN has one-to-one correspondence with graphics cards.

    When a graphical application starts, it connects to an X server (DISPLAY, host:displayno.screen).
For example, :0.0 mean local computer, X server instance 0, screen 0.
   
Xinerama::
    
    Xinerama feature is intended to combine the graphics cards into a single SCREEN.
    Xinerama extension (provided by libXinerama) allows application to query
physical monitor configuration.

    Drawbacks, 
    + 2D rendering operation must be executed on every card, which
leads to time-costs (X server is single-threaded) and memory costs.
    + GLX/3D acceleration is not supported.
    + all monitors share DPI(dots-per-inch)

Dual-head graphics cards
dual heads::
    Zaphod mode,  one SCREEN per head, DPI is right for each monitor.
    TwinView mode (Nvidia), default is cloned views.
