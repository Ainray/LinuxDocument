  The value of a void object may not be used in any way, and neither
explicit nor implicit conversion to any non-void type may be applied.

 A void expression may be used as the left operand of a comma operator.

      /* assert.h */
      #define assert(test) ((void)0)

  Any pointer to an object may be converted to type void * without loss
of information. If the result is converted back to the original pointer
type, the original pointer is recovered.


 A macro must can be expanded into a void expression.
        (assert(0<x),x<y)
