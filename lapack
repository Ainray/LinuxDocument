virtual memory::

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory

    A memory management technique provides a flat storage resources that
actually available on a given machine, may includes disk.

computer multitasking::

    + multiprogramming

        The second program is given a chance to run while
    the first program is waiting for peripheral access.

    + cooperative multitasking
        Application voluntarily ceded time to one another regularly.
    A poorly designed program either by performing extensive calculations
    or by busy waiting, would cause the whole system to hang.

    + preemptive multitasking
        Used by Unix-like, and modern Windows, which allow OS to process
    slices of operating time.

    + real time
        Hierarchical interrupt system is coupled with process
    prioritization to ensure that key actives were given a greater
    share available process time.

    + multithreading

        Threads are described as lightweight process because switching
        between threads does not involve changing the memory context.
vector processor::
array processor::
    + instruction set containing instructions that operate on one dimensional arrays of data (called vector.)

superscalar::
Refer to::
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar_processor

    An instruction-level parallelism within a single processor, by
dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the
processor. 
    Each execution unit is a logical arithmetic unit,
instead of a separate processor/core.
    Another technique pipelining dividing the execution unit into
different phases.

    + single-core superscalar processor is classified as SISD
    + single-core superscalar supporting short vector oporations, SIMD
    + multi-core superscalar processor, MIMD

distributed memory::
    + multiprocessor computer system in which each processor has its own private memory
    + computational tasks can only operate on local data
    + communication is need to operate remote data

shared memory::
    + multiprocessor use a single memory space

SuplerLU::
    + direct solution of large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations
    + MPI
    + OpenMP
    + CUDA

NUMPS::
    + symmetric positive definite matrices
    + general symmetric
    + general unsymmetric matrices
    + OpenMP within each MPI process
    + distributed memory parallel computers

    + linear equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue
    problems, singular value problems, matrix factorizations, condition
    number estimation

    + dense and band matrices, not general spare matrices

    + designed to 
        . single-processor vector supercomputers(then-modern, 1970s,1980s)
        . high-performance super-scalar workstations
        . share-memory parallel computers

    + satisfactorily on scalar machines(PC's, workstations, mainframes)
