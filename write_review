		  later with alternative strategies)
		. use a paper management system (e.g. Mendeley, Endnote)
		. seek previous reviews.
		  If there are already a few or several reviews of the literature
		  on your issue, do not give up, but just carry on with your own literature review:
			. discussing in your review the approeches, limitations, and  conclusions of past reviews
			. trying to find a new angle
			. incoprating new materials (citings of the existed reveiws are important new materials)
