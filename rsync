    Some options
        -a, archive mode, -rlptgoD
        -R, relative path

    Copy files

        rsync -av --info=progress2 /mnt/wing/Prj/03-refs/ 03-refs
        
        Be careful that the tailing "/" of the source, if no "/", the last part of source is "03-refs",
    then the new sub-directory is created in the destination directory "03-refs", in most case, that is
    not what you want.
        Sometimes, you want synchronize the source and destination directories, thus need to delete 
    redundant files in the destination directory which do not exist in source.

        rsync -av --info=progress2 --delete 03-refs/ /mnt/wing/Prj/03-refs/

    Symbolic link
        As usual symbolic link, link plus "/" refer to its destination directory, so if you just want to 
    copy the link file and its referent  path, no "/".
        When used -aR option, and the symbolic link file is prefixed some parent path, then it is copied 
    as usual file ( the referent path is still valid.). Removing it from its parent path is safe.
        
            rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/utorrent d1/
            rm -rf d1/home  # safe action
        + only a soft link is copy

        You can also limit the implied path by adding "./" in the path (ending "/" is necessary).
            rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/./utorrent d1/
        + utorrent directory will created in d1

        Be careful that the difference between 

            rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/utorrent d1/
    and 
            rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/utorrent/[file] d1/
        
        The first one will be copied as a regular file, and its referent
    is still valid. So you can copy both symbol link and its referent. 
    The latter one will create new path "d1/home/inray/utorrent" in the destination path "d1",
    so the original symbolic link file "utorrent" now is a directory, its contents are coped into
    "d1/home/inray/utorrent/".

    directory with -R option
        rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/Cash/ /tmp/
        rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/Cash /tmp/
    same, implied path and its contents are created
        rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/./Cash/ /tmp/
        rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/./Cash /tmp/
    same, no implied path and only its contents are created

    soft link in source with -R options
        + rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/zfracutil /tmp/ 
    implied path is created and zfracutil is only a soft link, and its reference is valid
        + rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/./zfracutil /tmp/ 
    no implied path  and zfracutil is only a soft link, and its reference is valid
        + rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/zfracutil/ /tmp/ 
    implied path is created and zfracutil directory and its contents is created
        + rsync -avR --info=progress2 /home/inray/./zfracutil/ /tmp/ 
    no implied path  and zfracutil directory and its contents is created

    soft link in source without -R options
        + rsync -av --info=progress2 /home/inray/zfracutil /tmp/ 
        + rsync -av --info=progress2 /home/inray/./zfracutil /tmp/ 
    same, zfracutil is copied as a regular file and its referent path is still valid
        + rsync -av --info=progress2 /home/inray/zfracutil/ /tmp/ 
        + rsync -av --info=progress2 /home/inray/./zfracutil/ /tmp/ 
    same, the contents of "zfracutil" are copied into /tmp/ directly, no ztracutil directory and no its implied path

    soft link in destination
