Real mode boot::
    
    three steps:
        1. BIOS prepare interrupt vector and service table --->
        2. load OS into RAM --->
        3. preparation for main function

        BIOS will construct interrupt vector table in the first 1KB MEM
    (0x00000~0x003FF), 256-bytes data zone at 0x00400~0x004FF), and load
    8KB interrupt services at 0x0E2CE, about 56KB after data zone.
        Every interrupt vector has 4bytes (2 bytes CS, 2 bytes IP). There
    are 256 interrupt vector, which point to an interrupt service.

    The second step can be divided into three minimal steps:
        2.1 BIOS int 0x19 load the first sector content BOOTSECT (512bytes)  into
            0x07C00~0x07DFF.

            BOOTSEC copy itself into 0x90000~0x901FF, then load setup at
            0x90200~, then load system code between 0x10000~0x3FFFF(192KB).


        2.2 BOOTSECT  load following 4 sectors and further following 240
            sectors into MEM by using int 0x13 ah=0x02


        2.3 execute SETUP

    Address space: 2^20=1MB

    BIOS entry: OxFFFF0, example range:0xFE000~0xFFFFF
        CS=0xFFFF
        IP=0x0000
