Comparison-based sorting::
     Theory 1 The average number of inversions in an array of n distinct
numbers is N(N-1)/4.
     Proof:
        For any array, L, of numbers, consider Lr, the list in reverse
    order. The total number of inversion in L and its reverse  Lr is
    N(N-1)/2. Thus, the average list has half this amount, or N(N-1)/4
    inversions.

        Theory 1 provides a very strong lower bound about any algorithm that
    only  exchanges adjacent elements.

    Theory 2 Algorithms that sorts by exchanging two adjacent elements
requires L(N^2) time on average.

        Theory 2 tell that we should exchange two elements with distance
    of more than 1 to reduce sorting time.
