Macro with parameter
    1. There is no space between macro name and left parenthesis (under
gcc)  

    2. Refer to macro parameter as string, using #, for example,

        #define assert1(test) if(!(test)) \
            fprintf (stderr, "Assertion failed: %s, file %s, line %i\n", \
                    #test, __FILE__, __LINE__)
